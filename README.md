## Definition


Hugging Face Transformers is one of the most popular libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This library offers a wide range of functionality for natural language processing, including:
- Language Modeling: Transformers provides a pre-trained transformer architecture for various NLP tasks, such as BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa. Users can utilize these models for fine-tuning on specific tasks or for direct use.
- Text Processing: Transformers has functions that make it easy to use the models for text processing, such as tokenization, encoding, and problem solving.
- Assessment: The library also provides various evaluation metrics and functions to perform NLP model assessment.
- Specialized Tasks: Transformers has support for various specialized tasks in NLP, such as sentiment analysis, translation, question and answer, and others.
Hugging Face Transformers is popular for its speed, flexibility, and broad support for various models and tasks in NLP.
